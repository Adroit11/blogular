            <p>Way back in 2012, it came to light that a flaw in Skype made it easy for hackers to
               acquire your IP address. Now, finally, Microsoft has updated the software so those details are hidden by
               default.Skype has offered the option to hide your IP address for a little while, but the update ,which is
               being rolled out today, means that it’s a standard feature. Previously, it was possible to expose a

            <p>Here’s absolutely gorgeous footage of a huge herd of reindeers making their way across
               Norway during winter from photographer Jan Helmer Olsen. Seeing all those reindeers walk through the snow
               in search for warmth is especially beautiful because of the aerial drone view. Their movement is almost
               balletic from up there.SPLOID is delicious brain candy. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and
